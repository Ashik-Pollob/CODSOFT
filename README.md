# Diabetes Prediction With Machine Learning
## Background
Diabetes is a leading cause of death for women in the world, affecting individuals from diverse racial and ethnic groups. Among Hispanic, African American, and American Indian/Alaska Native women, diabetes is the third leading cause of death, following heart disease and cancer. For white women, diabetes ranks as the fourth leading cause of death. Diabetes imposes a substantial economic burden on the world's economy, with direct medical costs and lost productivity due to illness and death estimated at over $245 billion annually.
