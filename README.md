# Diabetes Prediction With Machine Learning
## Background
Diabetes is a leading cause of death for women in the world, affecting individuals from diverse racial and ethnic groups. Among Hispanic, African American, and American Indian/Alaska Native women, diabetes is the third leading cause of death, following heart disease and cancer. For white women, diabetes ranks as the fourth leading cause of death. Diabetes imposes a substantial economic burden on the world's economy, with direct medical costs and lost productivity due to illness and death estimated at over $245 billion annually.
## Data Source
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. It can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set)
## Features

- Skin Thickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- Diabetes Pedigree Function: Diabetes pedigree function
- Age: Age (years)
- Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
